# Pokémon Rescue

## Overview
Professor Oak needs your help! While working on an update for the Pokedex, he accidentally deleted some crucial code. Your task is to rebuild the necessary functions using PySide6 and retrieve Pokémon data through the Poke API. With your Python programming skills, you’ll ensure his work gets back on track and the Pokedex is restored!

## Approach
I began by setting up the project and installing the required dependencies, including `PySide6` for the GUI and `requests` to fetch data from the Poke API. I then recreated the missing functions to retrieve Pokémon data and display it in the GUI. The app allows users to search for Pokémon and view their details. For the GUI, I designed a simple layout using PySide6 components and connected them to the backend functionality.

## Challenges Faced
Debugging the integration between the API and the PySide6 interface.
