# Beat The Buttons

## Overview
This task dives into the power of JavaScript through an interactive drum kit website. With 7 unique buttons, the goal was to link the CSS and JS files, add event listeners to play specific sounds when buttons are pressed, and apply styling to make the site visually appealing. By embedding Google Fonts, the final product became a blend of functionality and aesthetics.

## Approach
I started by linking the provided CSS and JS files to the `index.html`. Using JavaScript, I added event listeners so each button plays a unique sound when clicked. Finally, I styled the site with CSS, customized the button layout, and embedded fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) to improve aesthetics.

## Challenges Faced
- Debugging event listeners for simultaneous keypresses. 
- Associating sounds with buttons using the `Audio` API. 
- Styling buttons for responsiveness and a modern appearance.
