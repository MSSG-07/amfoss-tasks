# Operation Kernel

## Overview
In this task, we explore the core of an operating system: the kernel. The goal is to restore a custom kernel written in Rust, which was damaged during an ambush while it was being transported. The kernel, called the Kreschnder cypher, contains a unique text pattern that is crucial for activating a state-of-the-art aerial defense system. As a field engineer named Dingus, it’s up to you to repair and restore the kernel before it can be sent back into operation.

## Approach
I’m currently in the process of learning about operating system kernels, particularly how custom kernels are built and how Rust is used to implement them. I’m exploring the repository and reviewing the existing code to understand the structure and functionality of the Kreschnder cypher.

## Challenges Faced
- **Rust Language:** Since Rust is relatively new to me, understanding its syntax and memory safety features is a key area I’m focusing on.
- **Kernel Concepts:** Understanding the low-level concepts of operating systems, like how kernels manage hardware and system resources, requires careful study.
