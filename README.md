# AMFOSS TASKS

## INTRODUCTION

HI THERE! Myself M S Surya Gayathri. An undergrad pursuing B-TECH in 
Electrical and Computer Engineering.I enjoy solving problems by breaking them
down into manageable pieces and building efficient, functional solutions.
The main reason which always keeps my intrest in coding has always been a 
single moment - "The moment when codes gives solution without error in 
seconds, on which i have worked for hours!". Aside from coding my intrest
lies in Astronomy, Ancient architecures, Chess and Yoga.  

## WHY SHOULD WE CHOOSE YOU?

I'm really excited about the opportunity to join the coding club because I
genuinely love technology and coding. I’ve always been fascinated by how
programming can solve problems and bring ideas to life. I have good grap on
python compared to c programming . I am enthusiastic about contributing to 
the club’s activities, whether through organizing workshops, participating 
in hackathons. I look forward to applying my skills, passion, and creativity 
to support the club’s initiatives, while also collaborating with others. Most 
importantly, I am eager to learn from the diverse talent within the group, 
gaining new insights and expanding my knowledge in the process.

## WHAT ARE YOUR FIELDS OF INTEREST AND HOW DO YOU PLAN ON WORKING ON THEM?
 
To be exact my interest in coding have always been fun and engaging.
Therefore always tried to find new problems and solve them by my own,
at a point I found that my progress was decrease slowly as I was stuck to my
comfort zone in coding. That explains why I am intrested in AMFOSS. Other 
than this I work on my daily schedule to improve my skills in my hobbies.
