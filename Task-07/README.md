# Weather Guardian

## Overview
Comrade Kalashnikov had a rather unfortunate experience getting drenched on his visit to the motherland, and now he needs your help! Your task is to create a Chrome extension that provides real-time weather data for any location based on user input. With this tool, Kalashnikov can always be prepared and avoid further reprimands from his superiors!

## Approach
I built a simple Chrome extension using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The extension allows users to input a location (city name) and fetches the current weather data using the OpenWeather API. I designed a clean and responsive UI with CSS, and used JavaScript to handle API calls and display the weather details.

## Challenges Faced
- Learning how to work with the OpenWeather API and parsing JSON data effectively.
