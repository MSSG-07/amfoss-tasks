# Compute Shader

## Overview
This task dives into Vulkan and its powerful compute shaders, focusing on Shader Storage Buffer Objects (SSBOs). SSBOs provide the GPU with high-performance storage for reading and writing large amounts of data, and mastering them can unlock new efficiencies in computational workflows. The goal is to upgrade a basic compute shader to utilize SSBOs, enabling efficient data processing for tasks like simulations, image processing, and other computationally intensive applications.

## Approach
I’m currently in the process of learning about Vulkan and how to use SSBOs within compute shaders. I’m reviewing tutorials and documentation to understand how SSBOs function and how they can be integrated into Vulkan for tasks requiring complex data processing.
