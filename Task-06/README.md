# Flutter JumpStart

## Overview
This task is all about diving into game development using Google's Flutter framework. The goal is to replicate a demo bunny game and create a simple 2D character that can run and jump, similar to games like *Shadow Fight* or *Super Mario*. The game should be able to run on both Android and iOS, offering an opportunity to learn and implement cross-platform mobile development.

## Approach
Currently, Iâ€™m in the process of exploring and learning how to use Flutter for game development. I'm focusing on understanding how to create a responsive 2D game environment, set up game logic for character movement, and utilize Flutter's capabilities to run the game on Android.
