# The Command Line Cup

## Overview
Inspired by the magical Triwizard Tournament, this task transforms you into a contestant in the Terminal Wizard Championship! Your goal? Use the Linux terminal as your wand to explore, navigate, and discover secret code fragments scattered across files and git branches. Once you find all the fragments, youâ€™ll unlock the Terminal Wizard Cup!

## Approach
I started by cloning the repository and exploring its structure using basic Linux commands like `ls`, `cd`, and `cat`. 
The real challenge was navigating git branches. I listed them using `git branch -a` and switched between them with `git checkout`. Each branch felt like uncovering a new layer of the puzzle. Bit by bit, I collected the secret code fragments and pieced them together.

## Challenges
Handling git conflicts and unexpected file structures required careful attention.
