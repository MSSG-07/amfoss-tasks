# Code The Puzzles

## Overview
This task presented a set of puzzles designed to challenge and improve logical thinking. I used Python to implement the solutions because of its beginner-friendly syntax and powerful functionality, making it ideal for focusing on problem-solving without getting stuck on technical complexities.

## Approach
I began by exploring the puzzles on the Hackerrank contest page and carefully analyzing each one. For each puzzle, I broke the problem into smaller parts and crafted efficient solutions using Python. The languageâ€™s built-in functions and libraries made it easier to handle edge cases and optimize performance. Once a solution was complete, I tested it with various inputs to ensure accuracy and robustness before uploading it to the `task-04` directory.
